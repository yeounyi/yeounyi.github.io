<b><a href='https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021/588/week-1-march-1st-march-7th/3659/' target='_blank'> Missing Number </a></b>

Given an array ```nums``` containing ```n``` distinct numbers in the range ```[0, n]```, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

<b>Follow up</b>: Could you implement a solution using only ```O(1)``` extra space complexity and ```O(n)``` runtime complexity?
<br>

<b>Example</b>
```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

<br>

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # (sum of all nums if there were no missing number) - (sum of current input)
        return sum(range(len(nums)+1)) - sum(nums)
```
