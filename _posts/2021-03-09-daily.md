<b><a href='https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021/589/week-2-march-8th-march-14th/3665/' target='_blank'> Remove Palindromic Subsequences </a></b>

Given a string ```s``` consisting only of letters ```'a'``` and ```'b'```. In a single step you can remove one palindromic <b>subsequence</b> from ```s```.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

<br>

<b>Example</b>
```
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```

<br>
At first, I misunderstood this problem and thought I can only remove <b>consecutive</b> palindromic subsequences. 
<br>
```python
class Solution:
    # remove consecutive palindromic subsequences 
    def checkPalindrome(self, s:str) -> str:
        first_char = s[0]
        first_char_idx = [i for i,char in enumerate(s) if char == first_char]
        
        for idx in first_char_idx[::-1]:
            if s[0:idx+1] == s[0:idx+1][::-1]:
                if len(s) == idx+1:
                    return ''
                else:
                    return s[idx+1:] 
        
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        if s == '':
            return 0 
        
        result = s
        
        # count until remove all string 
        count = 0 
        while result != '':
            print(result)
            count+=1 
            result = self.checkPalindrome(result)
        
        return count
```

<br>
My code after realizing I can remove <b>non-consecutive</b> palindromic subsequences as well. 
<br>
```python
class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        if s == '':
            return 0 
        
        elif s == s[::-1]:
            return 1 
        
        else:
            return 2 
```
