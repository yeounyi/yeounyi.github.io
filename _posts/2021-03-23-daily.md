<b><a href='https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021/591/week-4-march-22nd-march-28th/3681/' target='_blank'> Vowel Spellchecker </a></b>

Given a ```wordlist```, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.

For a given ```query``` word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:

* Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (**case-insensitive**), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.
  * Example: ```wordlist = ["yellow"]```, ```query = "YellOw"```: ```correct = "yellow"```
  * Example: ```wordlist = ["Yellow"]```, ```query = "yellow"```: ```correct = "Yellow"```
  * Example: ```wordlist = ["yellow"]```, ```query = "yellow"```: ```correct = "yellow"```

* Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (**case-insensitive**), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
  * Example: ```wordlist = ["YellOw"]```, ```query = "yollow"```: ```correct = "YellOw"```
  * Example: ```wordlist = ["YellOw"]```, ```query = "yeellow"```: ```correct = "" (no match)```
  * Example: ```wordlist = ["YellOw"]```, ```query = "yllw"```: ```correct = "" (no match)```

In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:

* When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (**case-sensitive**), you should return the same word back.
* When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
* When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
* If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Given some ```queries```, return a list of words ```answer```, where ```answer[i]``` is the correct word for ```query = queries[i]```.

<b>Example</b>
<br>
```
Input: wordlist = ["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"], queries = ["kite","Kite","KiTe","Hare","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]
Output: ["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]
```

```python
class Solution:
    # convert query to regular expression that changes each vowel in query to [aeiou]
    def expandquery(self, query):
        query_list = list(query)
        vowels = [i for i, q in enumerate(query.lower()) if q in 'aeiou']
        for v in vowels:
            query_list[v] = '[aeiou]'
        return ''.join(query_list)
        
    def spellchecker(self, wordlist: List[str], queries: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        lowered_wordlist = [w.lower() for w in wordlist]
        
        for query in queries:
            # first priority: perfectly same 
            if query in wordlist:
                result.append(query)
                continue 
            
            # second priority: same except case 
            elif query.lower() in lowered_wordlist:
                result.append(wordlist[lowered_wordlist.index(query.lower())])
                continue
            
            expanded = self.expandquery(query.lower())
            vowelchange = re.findall(expanded, ' '.join(lowered_wordlist))
            
            # last priority: same after expanding vowels 
            if vowelchange != []:
                result.append(wordlist[lowered_wordlist.index(vowelchange[0])])
                continue
            
            else:
                result.append('')

        return result
