<b><a href='https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021/588/week-1-march-1st-march-7th/3662/' target='_blank'> Short Encoding of Words </a></b>

A <b>valid encoding</b> of an array of ```words``` is any reference string ```s``` and array of ```indices``` indices such that:

* ```words.length == indices.length```
* The reference string ```s``` ends with the ```'#'``` character.
* For each index ```indices[i]```, the <b>substring</b> of ```s``` starting from ```indices[i]``` and up to (but not including) the next ```'#'``` character is equal to words[i].


Given an array of ```words```, return the <b>length of the shortest reference string</b> ```s``` possible of any <b>valid encoding</b> of ```words```.

<br>

<b>Example</b>
```
Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "time#bell#" and indices = [0, 2, 5].
words[0] = "time", the substring of s starting from indices[0] = 0 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[1] = "me", the substring of s starting from indices[1] = 2 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[2] = "bell", the substring of s starting from indices[2] = 5 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLengthEncoding(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        distinct_words = list(set(words))
        
        for i, word in enumerate(distinct_words): # find if overlapping exists 
            for comparing_word in distinct_words[i+1:]:
                if len(comparing_word) >= len(word):
                    if comparing_word.endswith(word) and word in distinct_words:
                        distinct_words.remove(word)
                else:
                    if word.endswith(comparing_word) and comparing_word in distinct_words:
                        distinct_words.remove(comparing_word)
        
        total_length = sum([len(w) for w in distinct_words])
        
        # total length of all distinct words + number of '#'
        return total_length + len(distinct_words) 
```
