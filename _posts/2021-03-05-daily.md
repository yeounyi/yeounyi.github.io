<b><a href='https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021/588/week-1-march-1st-march-7th/3660/' target='_blank'> Intersection of Two Linked Lists </a></b>

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists: <br> <br>

begin to intersect at node c1.

### First Try: Exceeded Time Limits 


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if headA == None or headB == None:
            return None
        
        # Full list of nodes in headA  
        histA = []
        
        while headA.next != None:
            histA.append(headA)
            headA = headA.next
            
        histA.append(headA)
        
        # Check if headB has the same nodes in List histA 
        while headB.next != None:
            if headB in histA:
                return headB
            headB = headB.next
            
        if headB in histA:
            return headB 
        
        return None 
```

### Second Try: Accepted

Referred to <b><a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-function-to-get-the-intersection-point-of-two-linked-lists/' target='_blank'>this post, Method 3 </a></b> (Using difference of node counts) 

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution:
    # count the total number of nodes of the input ListNode
    def countNode(self, head:ListNode) -> int:
        count = 0
        while head.next != None:
            count += 1
            head = head.next
        return count + 1 # last one     
        
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if headA == None or headB == None:
            return None
        
        countA = self.countNode(headA)
        countB = self.countNode(headB)
        
        diff = countA - countB
        
        # if headA is longer than headB
        if diff > 0:
            for i in range(diff):
                headA = headA.next 
               
        # if headB is longer than headA 
        elif diff < 0 :
            for i in range(abs(diff)):
                headB = headB.next 
            
        while headA.next != None:
            if headA == headB:
                return headA 
            headA = headA.next
            headB = headB.next
        
        if headA == headB:
            return headA 
        
        return None 
        
```
