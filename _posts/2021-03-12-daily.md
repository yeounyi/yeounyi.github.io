<b><a href='https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021/589/week-2-march-8th-march-14th/3668/' target='_blank'> Coin Change </a></b>

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return ```-1```.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

<br>

<b>Example</b>
```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

Referred to <b><a href='https://trykv.medium.com/how-to-solve-minimum-coin-change-f96a758ccade' target='_blank'>this post</a></b> to solve this problem. 

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        total = [float("inf")] * (amount+1) # index: 0 ~ amount 
        total[0] = 0 # zero coin needed for the total amount to be zero 
        
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(len(total)):
                # this is needed for preventing index error in "total[i-coin]"
                if i - coin >= 0:
                    # +1 means it needs one more coin to reach total[i] from total[i-coin]
                    total[i] = min(total[i], total[i-coin] + 1)
                    
        if total[amount] == float("inf"):
            return -1
        else:
            return total[amount]        
```
