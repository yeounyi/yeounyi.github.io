<b><a href='https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/582/week-4-january-22nd-january-28th/3613/' target='_blank'> Determine if Two Strings Are Close </a></b>

Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

* Operation 1: Swap any two **existing** characters.
    * For example, ```abcde -> aecdb```
* Operation 2: Transform **every** occurrence of one **existing** character into another **existing** character, and do the same with the other character.
    * For example, ```aacabb -> bbcbaa``` (all ```a```'s turn into ```b```'s, and all ```b```'s turn into ```a```'s)


You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary. <br>
Given two strings, ```word1``` and ```word2```, return ```true``` if ```word1``` and ```word2``` are close, and ```false``` otherwise.
<br>
<br>

```python
from collections import Counter 

class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        # primary condition (1) should have the same length (2) should use the same alphabets 
        if len(word1) != len(word2) or set(word1) != set(word2): 
            return False
        else:
            counter1 = Counter(word1)
            counter2 = Counter(word2)
            
            # if the # of occurence of each alphabet in word1 and word2 are same
            # then, only need to do Operation 1 (swap)
            # counter1 == counter2 (can be included in the below condition)

            # if the # of occurence of each alphabet aren't same, but the # are same
            # e.g. word1: {a:2, b:3, c:1}, word2: {a:1, b:2, c:3} 
            # then we can apply Operation 2 to get the same occurence of each alphabet, then swap (Operation 1)  
            if set(dict(counter1).values()) == set(dict(counter2).values()):
                return True
            
            # if the # of occurence not same
            # e.g. word1: {a:2, b:3, c:1}, word2: {a:2, b:2, c:2}
            else:
                return False
```
