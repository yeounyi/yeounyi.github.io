<b><a href='https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021/590/week-3-march-15th-march-21st/3677/' target='_blank'> Keys and Rooms </a></b>

There are ```N``` rooms and you start in room ```0```.  Each room has a distinct number in ```0, 1, 2, ..., N-1```, and each room may have some keys to access the next room. 

Formally, each room ```i``` has a list of keys ```rooms[i]```, and each key ```rooms[i][j]``` is an integer in ```[0, 1, ..., N-1]``` where ```N = rooms.length```.  A key ```rooms[i][j] = v``` opens the room with number ```v```.

Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room ```0```). 

You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

Return ```true``` if and only if you can enter every room.

<br>

<b>Example</b>
<br>
```
Input: [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can't enter the room with number 2.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        N = len(rooms)
        visited = [False] * N 
        
        # visit unlocked room 0 
        visited[0] = True
        current_keys = list(set(rooms[0]))
        
        while current_keys != []:
            for key in current_keys:
                if not visited[key]: # if not visited yet 
                    visited[key] = True
                    current_keys.remove(key)
                    
                    for add_key in rooms[key]:
                        if not visited[add_key]:
                            current_keys += [add_key]
                            current_keys = list(set(current_keys))

        if False in visited:
            return False
        else:
            return True
```
