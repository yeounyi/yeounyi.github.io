<b><a href='https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021/588/week-1-march-1st-march-7th/3657/' target='_blank'> Distribute Candies </a></b>

Alice has ```n``` candies, where the ```i-th``` candy is of type ```candyType[i]```. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.

The doctor advised Alice to only eat ```n / 2``` of the candies she has (```n``` is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.

Given the integer array ```candyType``` of length ```n```, return the <b>maximum</b> number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats ```n / 2``` of them.
<br>

<b>Example</b>
```
Input: candyType = [1,1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Whether she eats types [1,2], [1,3], or [2,3], she still can only eat 2 different types.
```

<br>

```python
class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, candyType: List[int]) -> int:
        candy_amount = int(len(candyType)/2) # she can only eat n/2 candies 
        num_types = len(set(candyType))
        
        if num_types >= candy_amount:
            return candy_amount
        
        else:
            return num_types
```
